# CTAproject
benchmark five different sorting algorithms:

Sorting Algorithms:

  => Bubble Sort.	
  
  => Selection Sort.
  
  => Quicksort.
  
  => Counting Sort.	
  
  => Radix Sort.	
  
  The aim of this project is to explore the significance of sorting algorithms in minimizing computational expenses associated with processing large amounts of data. The study introduces the concepts of time and space complexity and how they serve to distinguish and categorize diverse algorithms. The project conducts a comparative analysis of five sorting algorithms, namely Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quicksort, Counting Sort, and Radix Sort, using them as a case study. The study concludes that the selection of an algorithm always hinges on the specific application and the attributes of the dataset that requires sorting.

Implementation & Benchmarking

The flowchart that we used to obtain the running time for the different sorting algorithms. To study the running time of algorithms in a systematic way we first generate an array of random numbers ranging from 0 to 500000. So, in each test set, we took a part of this primary array and tested it on all the algorithms, with this strategy, we have a systematic evaluation of each algorithm.
